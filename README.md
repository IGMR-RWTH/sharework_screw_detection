# Screw Detection

This C++ package locates and classifies screws and holes in camera images. The computer vision model is particularly simple as a random tree with only five features is generated. This makes the application simple and understandable while maintaining a good classification accuracy. The package was developed within the European project [SHAREWORK](https://sharework-project.eu/) and is part of a scientific publication at the European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO) 2023.

Dependencies:
- OpenCV
- ROS (ROS wrapper only)
